App Overview

The app stores various emoticons composed of 
Unicode characters. Emoticons are sorted by category,
where they are each placed into their own button.
When you press a button, it will copy the emoticon
shown by the button to your clipboard!

NOTE: Although the app is backwards compatible, Unicode characters only
show properly from Android 4.1 (Jellybean) and onwards. BUT...
you can always troll your friends who use older phones then :)
